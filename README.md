Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

# Introduction to CNN

Convolutional Neural Networks use convolutional kernels that slide over the pixel matrix, performing dot products to generate feature maps.
